# ProteinUI

### Vue 2 UI component library

> ProteinUI is the UI library that you always wanted. It does not enforce a particular design principle; rather, it provides both basic and advanced components that you can use together or separately. It integrates with any other UI libraries or frameworks nicely, since each component is standalone and highly customizable.
